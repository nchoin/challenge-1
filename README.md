# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
The purpose of this project was to apply newly learned skills related debugging, CSS stylesheets and basic HTML. Given a starter code, I had to increase the accessible alt attributes, reduce redundancy in CSS style sheet, and apply semantic HTML elemants without changing the the layout of the original website. 
I found the task to a helpful learning opportunity because I could focus on the code already provided, refactoring it, rather than starting from scratch. I saw information from instruction applied. The task offered me time to analyze content, look for patterns and problem solve. 
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
