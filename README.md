# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
The purpose of this project was to apply newly learned skills related to CSS stylesheets, basic HTML and debugging a given code. Given a starter code, I had to increase the accessible alt attributes, reduce redundancy in CSS style sheet, and apply semantic HTML elements without changing the layout/appearance of the original website. 
I found the task to a helpful learning opportunity focusing on the code already provided, refactoring it, rather than starting from scratch. I saw information from instruction applied. The task offered me time to analyze content, look for patterns and problem solve.

## Installation

I cloned the starter code provided for the students in the class. 

## Usage

This was a learning activity only. The website isn't connected to a real company.

## Credits
The starter code was provided by the coding bootcamp programmers from UConn. Our instructors and TA provided guidance and offered advise on how to work through the project. 

I used notes from the coding bootcamp class I am taking through UConn. I also used the information from W3Schools at https://www.w3schools.com/. I referenced the book <i>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</i> by Mike McGrath.
